    section: 'Ancient Egypt',
    p1: "Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa. It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer). The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative instability known as 'Intermediate Periods'. The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age, or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.",
    p2: "Ancient Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the New Kingdom, ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Levant. After this period, it entered an era of slow decline. During the course of its history, ancient Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the Hyksos, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians under Alexander the Great. The Greek Ptolemaic Kingdom, formed in the aftermath of Alexander's death, ruled until 30 BC, when, under Cleopatra, it fell to the Roman Empire and became a Roman province. Egypt remained under Roman control until the 640s AD, when it was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate.",

His second in command, the vizier, king's representative, coordinated land surveys, treasury, building projects, legal system, archives. Regionally, up to 42 administrative regions, nomes, each governed by a nomarch accountable to the vizier. Temples, backbone of economy, places of worship, collecting, storing kingdom's wealth in granaries, treasuries overseen by redistributing overseers.",
    p2: 'Centrally organized economy, strict control; ancient Egyptians used barter with grain sacks, deben (roughly 91g of copper or silver). Workers paid in grain; laborer earned 5+1⁄2 sacks/month, foreman 7+1⁄2 sacks/month. Fixed prices nationwide; e.g., shirt cost five copper deben, cow 140 deben. Grain traded by fixed price list. Fifth century BC saw introduction of coined money from abroad; initially standardized precious metal pieces, later used as true money, relied upon by international traders.',

    section: 'Social status',
    p1: "Egyptian society was highly stratified, with social status prominently displayed. Farmers, the majority, had their agricultural produce owned by the state, temple, or noble family that owned the land, subjected to labor tax and corvée labor. Artists and craftsmen, under state control, worked in temple shops, paid from state treasury. Scribes and officials formed the upper 'white kilt class' displaying status in art and literature. Below were priests, physicians, engineers with specialized training; slavery's existence in ancient Egypt remains debated.",
    p2: 'The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, across all social classes, as essentially equal under the law. Even the lowest peasants could petition the vizier for redress. While slaves mostly served as indentured servants, they could buy and sell their servitude, work towards freedom or nobility, and receive medical treatment. Both genders had rights to own property, make contracts, marry, divorce, inherit, and resolve disputes in court. Married couples could jointly own property and protect against divorce with marriage contracts stipulating financial obligations. Compared to ancient Greece, Rome, and modern societies, Egyptian women had greater personal choices, legal rights, and opportunities. Some, like Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VII, became pharaohs, and others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun. Despite freedoms, few held official roles, primarily serving secondary roles in temples with limited education opportunities compared to men.',

    p1: 'The Egyptian language, a northern Afro-Asiatic language closely related to Berber and Semitic languages, boasts the longest known written history, from around 3200 BC to the Middle Ages, remaining a spoken language even longer. Ancient Egyptian phases include Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Late Egyptian, Demotic, and Coptic. Before Coptic, Egyptian writings lacked discernible dialect differences, though it was likely spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.',
    p2: 'Ancient Egyptian started as a synthetic language but transitioned to become more analytic over time. Late Egyptian introduced prefixal definite and indefinite articles, replacing older inflectional suffixes. There was also a shift from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic continues to be used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and its traces are evident in modern Egyptian Arabic.',

    section: 'Architecture',
    p1: 'The architecture of ancient Egypt features iconic structures such as the Great Pyramids of Giza and the temples at Thebes. These building projects were orchestrated and financed by the state for religious, commemorative, and political purposes, aiming to underscore the extensive authority of the pharaoh. Ancient Egyptian architects were highly adept, employing basic yet efficient tools and surveying instruments to construct massive stone edifices with remarkable accuracy and precision, techniques that continue to inspire awe today.',
    p2: 'The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples, such as those at Giza, were characterized by single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns. During the New Kingdom, architects expanded temple architecture by adding features like pylons, open courtyards, and enclosed hypostyle halls in front of the sanctuary. This architectural style remained standard until the Greco-Roman period. In the Old Kingdom, the mastaba was the predominant tomb architecture—a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber. The step pyramid of Djoser exemplifies this style, consisting of stacked stone mastabas. While pyramids continued to be built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, many later rulers opted for less conspicuous rock-cut tombs. The pyramid form persisted in the private tomb chapels of the New Kingdom and in the royal pyramids of Nubia.',

    section: 'Religious Beliefs',
    p1: 'Beliefs in the divine and the afterlife were fundamental to ancient Egyptian civilization from its earliest days; pharaonic authority rested on the divine right of kingship. The Egyptian pantheon comprised gods with supernatural abilities whom people invoked for assistance or protection. Despite their powers, these gods were not always seen as entirely benevolent, requiring appeasement through offerings and prayers. The composition of the pantheon evolved over time as new deities ascended in status, yet priests did not attempt to unify the diverse and occasionally conflicting myths into a cohesive system. Instead, these various perceptions of divinity were viewed as complementary layers in understanding the complexities of reality.',
    p2: "Gods in ancient Egypt were revered through cult temples overseen by priests acting on behalf of the king. Central to each temple was a cult statue housed within a shrine. These temples were not places of public worship or congregation; only during specific feast days and ceremonies was the god's statue paraded for public adoration. Typically, the deity's realm was secluded from the outside world, accessible solely to temple officials. Ordinary citizens could worship personal statues in their homes, and they used amulets for protection against chaotic forces. Following the New Kingdom, there was a shift away from the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary, leading to a focus on direct worship of the gods. Consequently, priests developed oracles to convey divine will directly to the people.",

    p1: 'The ancient Egyptian military had the crucial roles of defending Egypt from foreign invasions and asserting Egyptian dominance in the ancient Near East. During the Old Kingdom, it safeguarded mining expeditions in the Sinai and engaged in civil conflicts in the First and Second Intermediate Periods. Fortifications along vital trade routes, like those at Buhen leading to Nubia, were also maintained by the military. Additionally, military bases such as the fortress at Sile supported expeditions to the Levant. In the New Kingdom, successive pharaohs utilized the standing Egyptian army to launch campaigns, conquering territories including Kush and parts of the Levant.',
    p2: "Typical military equipment in ancient Egypt included bows and arrows, spears, and round-topped shields crafted by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame. In the New Kingdom, chariots were introduced, initially by the Hyksos invaders, and later adopted by the Egyptian military. With the advent of bronze, weapons and armor advanced significantly: shields were made from solid wood with bronze buckles, spears were tipped with bronze points, and the khopesh sword was adopted from Asiatic soldiers. Pharaohs were often depicted leading their armies, though there is debate about whether they directly engaged in frontline combat. Soldiers were primarily recruited from the general population, but during and after the New Kingdom, mercenaries from regions like Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to bolster Egypt's military forces.",

    section: 'Legacy',
    p1: 'The culture and monuments of ancient Egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world. Egyptian civilization significantly influenced the Kingdom of Kush and Meroë with both adopting Egyptian religious and architectural norms (hundreds of pyramids (6–30 meters high) were built in Egypt/Sudan), as well as using Egyptian writing as the basis of the Meroitic script. Meroitic is the oldest written language in Africa, other than Egyptian, and was used from the 2nd century BC until the early 5th century AD. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome. The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view as a place of mystery.',
    p2: "During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam, but interest in Egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe, as evident in symbolism such as the Eye of Providence and the Great Seal of the United States. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities. Napoleon arranged the first studies in Egyptology when he brought some 150 scientists and artists to study and document Egypt's natural history, which was published in the Description de l'Égypte.",
